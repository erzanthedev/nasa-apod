# 🌌 NASA APOD Project 🌌

Welcome to my NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) project!
This project showcases stunning images from NASA's APOD API.
I started with a template that provided some CSS for appearance to speed up the build and focus more on the logic and functionality.
I then added my own HTML, JavaScript, and a bit more CSS to create this engaging website.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to learn how to use open APIs to build a website that displays pictures from NASA and allows users to save their favorite images.

## ✨ Purpose

This project aimed to achieve the following:

- **Fetching NASA API**: Learned how to fetch data from NASA's APOD API using JavaScript.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Created and appended DOM elements dynamically using the fetched data.
- **Saving and Deleting Favorites**: Implemented functionality to save and delete favorite images, using local storage to persist user selections.
- **Updating Favorites**: Built logic to update the list of favorite images efficiently.
- **Navigation**: Added navigation to switch between different pages for a seamless user experience.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **API Integration**: Enhanced my understanding of how to integrate and fetch data from open APIs.
- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Improved my JavaScript skills, particularly in the areas of asynchronous programming and event handling.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Strengthened my ability to dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements based on API data.
- **Local Storage**: Gained experience with using local storage to save and manage user data.
- **User Interaction**: Learned how to create an interactive user interface that responds to user actions.
